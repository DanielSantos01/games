# Games
A repository to store the development of simple games

### Notes
- All python games was delevoped by using the version 3.10 of the python programming language and the version 2.0.0.dev6 of pygame module
- I'm not sure if the python games will work fine with different package versions
- The purspose is to create every single game in both platforms
- I'm seriously thinking about start to develop also using the web platform (JS, HTML and CSS). Maybe then there's something like that around here.

### Games
- Alien Invasion
- Breakout
- Flappy Bird


### How to run?
- Python games can be executed by running the ```run_game.py``` file
- Java games can be executed by running the ```RunGame.java``` file
